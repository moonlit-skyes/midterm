    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>hi i'm skye.</p><br>
    <p>i've been coding on and off for nearly a decade. i seem to fall off a lot. right now i'm trying to make it stick but my life seems to keep imploding. i really hope to get a job in some sort of coding position. i've gotten tired of fast food, nursing, phone repair, delivery, trading card tournements, and making sandwiches for a nuclear submarine base. you know, normal entry level jobs evereyone's had.</p><br>
    <p>i'll be honest i'm mostly typing all this out so i have text to use as filler for testing styles. also actually having content in an example website with a whopping three pages would be nice.</p><br>
    <p>doubt anyone would have read all the way here so might as well ramble about gender for a bit</p><br>
    <p>gender really annoys me. for context my usual presentation to the outside world is one of two 'modes', those being 'trans girl' and 'i don't care'. the first is me being femminine, the presentation that would be expected of a 'trans gender male to female' person. the second is knowing even if i do put all that effort in i'll still just be a *slur of choice here* to most of the people i talk to. i get misgendered in public agresssively by everyone and my mother introduced me as her son while i was wearing a skirt and thigh highs. my mom also wants people like me to die so i might be a little bitter. but to be honest on the inside i'm not a girl or a boy or non-binary or whatever. there just isn't a gender there. its called being agender and whatever gender expression i do have is purely reactionary, a temperary construct as defined within our culture's understanding of gender presentation and gender roles. so i came up with a gender of my own to shortcut saying all that, so lately i've been calling myself a voidling demi-boy. while yes i take hormones, present feminely when trying to dress up and everything, i identify more as a boy, kinda. it's complicated and i'm not sure how to explain it without there being some contextual understanding of gender that i typically don't feel that most people have, even other trans people. it requires a kind of internal crituqe of your own sense of gender and idea of it. anyway i never will tell my parents i call myself my partner's boyfriend, if they won't respect me as a girl they sure as hell won't respect me as an agender gremlin. ranting about my parents in a midterm. i dunno, being told i was a miracle my whole life by someone then having them refuse to call me by my own name hurts.</p><br>
    <p>anyway i've really been getting into digimon. this is veemon.</p><br>

    <p>i love him. he was the main character's digimon partner in the second season of the original show.</p><br>
    <p>did i say getting into digimon? that was a blalant lie. i've been into digimon since it first aired on tv. i just got into the card game. this is where i get upset at veemon. this little bundle of blue joy that i love so dearly doesn't lend himself easily to the arctype i want to build the most with right now, Magnamon. long story short veemon has a lot of higher teir forms. he has eleven different armor forms, two differnet second stage forms and a myraid of dna evoliutions and form changes and blah blah blah. and nearly all of them are in the card game but that leaves Magnamon, his armor form with the digimetal of miracles, only has three cards for it, with a couple supporting cards, but that means an armor deck needs an outside finisher like... jesmon gx or something?? i'm not sure i don't play meta i like seeing my favorite little monsters and staying in theme. i really like veemon.</p><br>
    <p>used to play magic a lot before but after the whole pinkerton fiasco i've lost a lot of faith in a company i did not have much faith in.</p><br>
    <p>i'm dating three people. all of them wonderful people that i'm so happy to have in my life supporting me. i wouldn't be able to function without them some days.</p><br>
    <!--It was here I realized how this page actually looked. Gotta keep going with it.-->
    <p>first is Liliana, I've been dating her the longest. She's my wonderful girlfriend and I often liken her to a fox, both because of how often she tries to trick me and for how quickly she runs into a bush when she hears a noise. she's an artist that hasn't gotten to practice art in a while and recently we've started to doodle on our ipad together. i hope to spend the rest of my life with her. we joke about marriage a lot and the only reason why i haven't gotten engaged with her is incredible trauma from a past engagement.</p><br>
    <p>then i started dating </p>
