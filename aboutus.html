    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>hi i'm skye.</p>
    <p>i've been coding on and off for nearly a decade. i seem to fall off a lot. right now i'm trying to make it stick but my life seems to keep imploding. i really hope to get a job in some sort of coding position. i've gotten tired of fast food, nursing, phone repair, delivery, trading card tournements, and making sandwiches for a nuclear submarine base. you know, normal entry level jobs evereyone's had.</p>
    <p>identity wise i'd call myself a puppy over really anything else. my aim in life is to help people and be a place of comfort for others. i aspire to be actively nice to everyone i meet. i want to be something good in the world. while obviously being an idealist it may come to shock you that politically i'm an anarchist, the kind that wants to build parallel power structures to the white supermacy soup that is capitalist liberalism. my personal policies that involve the united states begin uniformly with 'land back'. i could go on but then we'd have to throw around scary words that start with T that aren't slurs old people call me.</p>
    <p>i aspire to be an artist, a writer to be specific. i have a story about the last two superheroes in a world that doesn't need saving anymore. one of them can't stop thinking about the past and the other can't stop thinking about the future. they spend a while talking and there aren't really any fights or anything and the back story and lore and all that is just there so i can use two twinks to talk about moving on and accepting living in the present after trauma, accepting people can hurt you and still be a part of your life. things i still need to work on. please don't read all this mess. you'll go even more insane than I am.</p>
    <p>i'll be honest i'm mostly typing all this out so i have text to use as filler for testing styles. also actually having content in an example website with a whopping three pages would be nice.</p>
    <p>doubt anyone would have read all the way here so might as well ramble about gender for a bit</p>
    <p>gender really annoys me. for context my usual presentation to the outside world is one of two 'modes', those being 'trans girl' and 'i don't care'. the first is me being femminine, the presentation that would be expected of a 'trans gender male to female' person. the second is knowing even if i do put all that effort in i'll still just be a *slur of choice here* to most of the people i talk to. i get misgendered in public agresssively by everyone and my mother introduced me as her son while i was wearing a skirt and thigh highs. my mom also wants people like me to die so i might be a little bitter. but to be honest on the inside i'm not a girl or a boy or non-binary or whatever. there just isn't a gender there. its called being agender and whatever gender expression i do have is purely reactionary, a temperary construct as defined within our culture's understanding of gender presentation and gender roles. so i came up with a gender of my own to shortcut saying all that, so lately i've been calling myself a voidling demi-boy. while yes i take hormones, present feminely when trying to dress up and everything, i identify more as a boy, kinda. it's complicated and i'm not sure how to explain it without there being some contextual understanding of gender that i typically don't feel that most people have, even other trans people. it requires a kind of internal crituqe of your own sense of gender and idea of it. anyway i never will tell my parents i call myself my partner's boyfriend, if they won't respect me as a girl they sure as hell won't respect me as an agender gremlin. ranting about my parents in a midterm. i dunno, being told i was a miracle my whole life by someone then having them refuse to call me by my own name hurts.</p>
    <p>anyway i've really been getting into digimon. this is veemon.</p><br>

    <p>i love him. he was the main character's digimon partner in the second season of the original show.</p><br>
    <p>did i say getting into digimon? that was a blalant lie. i've been into digimon since it first aired on tv. i just got into the card game. this is where i get upset at veemon. this little bundle of blue joy that i love so dearly doesn't lend himself easily to the arctype i want to build the most with right now, Magnamon. long story short veemon has a lot of higher teir forms. he has eleven different armor forms, two differnet second stage forms and a myraid of dna evoliutions and form changes and blah blah blah. and nearly all of them are in the card game but that leaves Magnamon, his armor form with the digimetal of miracles, only has three cards for it, with a couple supporting cards, but that means an armor deck needs an outside finisher like... jesmon gx or something?? i'm not sure i don't play meta i like seeing my favorite little monsters and staying in theme. i really like veemon.</p><br>
    <p>used to play magic a lot before but after the whole pinkerton fiasco i've lost a lot of faith in a company i did not have much faith in.</p><br>
    <p>i'm dating three people. all of them wonderful people that i'm so happy to have in my life supporting me. i wouldn't be able to function without them some days.</p><br>
    <!--It was here I realized how this page actually looked. Gotta keep going with it.-->
    <p>first is Liliana, I've been dating her the longest. She's my wonderful girlfriend and I often liken her to a fox, both because of how often she tries to trick me and for how quickly she runs into a bush when she hears a noise. she's an artist that hasn't gotten to practice art in a while and recently we've started to doodle on our ipad together. i hope to spend the rest of my life with her. we joke about marriage a lot and the only reason why i haven't gotten engaged with her is incredible trauma from a past engagement.</p><br>
    <p>then i started dating Emily, Liliana started dating her about four months after I did. also me and emily admittedly only met months before i met liliana to go on *dates* and only got serious after I'd started dating Liliana. I encouraged the pair to flirt cause they were obviously into each other. They recently celebrated their second aniversary by going out to dinner Wednesday and they're going out to dinner tomorrow, Saturday. Yes I'm typing this part on the day the assignment is due. My nerves have been so bad I've been doing a bit at a time. I keep going through revisions and keep getting over ambitious. Anyway Emily, my girlfriend who I love. Her. She's great. Kinda an irredeemable nerd, love her for that, and loves to talk about what's on her mind. We actually went to an art museum as part of a date today and we had a nice talk about some of the modern art in the exhibits since I'm a wannabe artist and she likes to watch a lot of youtube videos about art.</p><br>
    <p>and then trae! Who like Emily before them, I only started dating after knowing them before both of my other partners, going on nearly ten years now, and only started dating them after they moved out here. they're my boyfriend and are non-binary so i use they/them pronouns for them. they're great. they've been one of my best friends for so long its hard to imagine my life without them. i still have so much learning about them to do and i'm looking forward to it honestly. how we communciate is completely different from one another and while it presents a lot of challanges i think it'll be really rewarding in the end.</p><br>
    <p>that's about all i can think about.</p><br>
