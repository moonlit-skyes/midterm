    <h1>Issues Alabama is facing</h1>
    <p>
        So other than racism, anti-Black racisim in particular, the main issue that the area is facing is clay hates typical septic systems. Septic systems rely on one of two things, either a sewer or the ground. In the sewer's case it is simply dumped into the pipe with the rest of the population's waste. But for the ground type it is graduly absorbed by the surounding soil. Clay does not like that happening. It sufficates the decomposition process that'd allow the waste to gradually turn into soil or feed it. In the case of waste water specifically clay likes to expand on contact with moisture and that prevents water from flowing through it effectively. Eventually this causes water to get ejected out of the soil, straight up in some cases causing pools of water to form above the septic systems.

        There are technologies that could bypass this soil issue if not for the racisim that strangles funding from these mostly black areas.
