miderm on probably one of the most depressing topics i've read in a while.
trying out some stuff. the exact pixel messurements are kinda finicky and i can't seem to make things to work in just the right way.
i'm actually a bit of a perfectionist, if i can't make things perfect i usually give up on it.
and that explains my dating history in my early twenties.
i need to work on my need to jam both humor and self reflection into every little space i can find it.
i also need to work on actually writing something useful in the read me. there's six pages for this site i guess.








































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































you ever feel like you're going crazy?
idk reality hasn't felt real for a long time
fifteen years of therapy and mood stabilizers aren't enough i guess
i just want things to stop being so scary.
