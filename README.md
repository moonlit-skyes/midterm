miderm on probably one of the most depressing topics i've read in a while.
trying out some stuff. the exact pixel messurements are kinda finicky and i can't seem to make things to work in just the right way.
i also need to work on actually writing something useful in the read me. there's six pages for this site i guess.
genuinely sorry there is no sketch. i was fifteen miles outta town before i realized i left my rear tire at home kinda deal.
this thing is littered with typos, i can't spell to save my life. if you see really bad grammar n no capitalization its probably not supposed to be that serious since this is how i type when i'm just kinda train of thought typing. the about us page is full of that. don't take it too seriously, i have a myriad of mental illnesses and most of my jokes don't land unless you need mood stabilizers.
