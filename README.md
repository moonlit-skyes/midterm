miderm on probably one of the most depressing topic i've read in a while.
trying out some stuff. the exact pixel messurements are kinda finicky and i can't seem to make things to work in just the right way.

you ever feel like you're going crazy?
idk reality hasn't felt real for a long time
fifteen years of therapy and mood stabilizers aren't enough i guess
